QuestMVC
========

This is my MVC based on Lydia

Download
========

You can download Lydia from QuestMVC.

git clone git://github.com/HenkeQuest/QuestMVC.git 

You can review its source directly on github: https://github.com/HenkeQuest/QuestMVC


Installation
============

First you have to make the data-directory writable. This is the place where Lydia needs to be able to write and create files.

cd questmvc; chmod 777 site/data 

Second, QuestMVC has some modules that need to be initialised. You can do this through a controller. Point your browser to the following link.

module/install 
•In /index.php you can define your installation path and site path
•In /site/config.php you can set your personal settings.
